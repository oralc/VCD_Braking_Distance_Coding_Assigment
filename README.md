**Time-based Simulation of Braking Distance**

_Spyder - (Python 3.7)_

**How to Run:**
Step_1: Please, save the code locally to use argparser<br />
Step_2: Run the code with desired inputs in the console. (Please find the example command code below) 
E.g: runfile('vcd_code.py', '--initial_velocity_kmh 50 --mass 1100 --road_type concrete --weather dry --angle 0')

**Input Data:**
  angle: Positive for uphill || Negative for downhill) 
  road_type: concrete, ice, water, gravel, sand
  weather: dry, wet, aquaplaning
  initial_velocity_kmh: initial velocity in km/h
  mass: mass of the vehicle

**Algoritmh**:
  The code calculates the distance traveled and the decrease in velocity in the time step until the vehicle comes to stop with a while loop.
  Then, it plots the velocity and distance as a time-based simulation.
  



Thank you.
